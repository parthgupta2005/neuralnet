## Project Title

NeuralNetworkHandwriting - A Basic Java Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Description

NeuralNetworkHandwriting is a simple implementation of a feedforward neural network built in Java. It is designed to recognize handwritten digits using binary input data. The project demonstrates the core principles of neural networks such as forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight adjustment to learn from input data.

This project is a great example of machine learning fundamentals, showcasing how a neural network can be implemented from scratch without external libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (Version 8 or higher)
- **IDE or Terminal** (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or any terminal with Java support)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NeuralNetworkHandwriting
   ```

3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac NeuralNetworkHandwriting.java
   ```

### Executing the Program

To run the program, use the following command in your terminal or IDE:
```bash
java NeuralNetworkHandwriting
```

Once executed, the program will:
- Train the neural network on the provided binary data set.
- Validate the network against test data.
- Output the networkâ€™s predictions and accuracy.

## Features

- **Feedforward Neural Network**: A 3-layer architecture (input, hidden, output).
- **Binary Data**: Input data representing handwritten digits in binary form.
- **Backpropagation**: Adjusts weights to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Outputs final accuracy after testing on validation data.

## Built With

- **Java** - The programming language used to develop the entire project.
